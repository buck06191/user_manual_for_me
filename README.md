# User Manual For Stephen Geller

Inspired by [this repo by Gidi Morris](https://github.com/gmmorris/user_manual_for_me) and [this article by Cassie Robinson](https://medium.com/@cassierobinson/a-user-manual-for-me-d3a851fbc694).

A User Manual for working with me.

## Conditions I like to work in

I work best in environments where I am surrounded by the behaviour I'd like to replicate. 
I am a copycat and a chameleon, and get good work done when surrounded by people doing the same.

Unfortunately, I am also both easily distracted and frustrated when taken away from my work when I'm engaged in it, so if I look like I'm super-focused it's probably best to message me first if possible. 

Pro tip: If I have my headphones on and look like I'm enjoying my music, it means I'm really engaged with my work!

## The times/hours I like to work

I'm learning to be more of a morning person, but for now I aim to arrive at the office (by bike or tube) between 9:15am and 10am and leave between 5:15pm and 6pm.

I aim to have lunch at 12:30pm on the dot, but will actually have it somewhere between 12pm and 1pm.

## The best ways to communicate with me

If I'm stuck into work, I always appreciate you messaging me on the communication platform tool of choice (Slack, GChat) before approaching me if it's a non-urgent request. 
It allows me to handle interactions at my own pace, since I can sometimes get quickly exhausted by social interaction overload. 
That being said, if I've forgotten that we have a meeting or I promised to help or do something, please grab me!

## The ways I like to receive feedback

GM Be direct.
GM I am much more comfortable with candor and difficult conversations, than with things being left unspoken, so please just be straight with me.

GM I consider all feedback a learning opportunity, and do my very best not to get defensive.

GM I have a hard time taking feedback in asynchronous form, such as emails or instant messaging, so please, focus in synchronous forms of communication.

## Things I need

Time to wake up in the morning. I get better work done (and am nicer to work with!) when I have some time to look over emails, get some personal admin done and adjust to starting the day. 
This normally takes around 30 minutes, which I'll normally spend with a coffee.

To optimise my learning, I need to do it the right way. My [VARK](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/vak-learning-styles.htm) learning tool preference is as follows: 

1. Kinesthetic (hands-on)
2. Visual (diagrams)
3. Reading/Writing
4. Auditory

So, where possible, I also need to be able to get hands-on with stuff in order to learn it. Don't worry, I know this is not always possible. 

## Things I struggle with

I have real issues with my memory, and can be embarrassed when I forget things that I've said, learnt or done. 
So if I forget your name, a concept you absolutely nailed an explanation of to me moments before or a piece of information I was meant to remember, I'm really sorry.
I'm working on it, but the positive side is that once something is in my head, it's there for a very long time and hard to get rid of!

With that in mind, I can also struggle with my focus. Since I get worried I'll forget tasks when they pop into my head, I'll try to immediately complete them when I think of them. 
The cost of this is often switching between tasks at a lightning-pace, which can be very frustrating for those working with me. Something I do this in meetings, other times when pairing.
If you see me doing this, please feel free and comfortable to call me out on it, even by simply saying "Stephen, you're doing the thing again." 
I'm not always great at seeing the impact it has on others, and will appreciate you giving me a heads up. 

Although I sometimes portray myself more extroverted than I seem, I am in reality an introvert who often runs out of batteries to engage in social interaction. 
I naturally want to be included in things, but may turn down offers for social occasions if I feel I just need to recharge. This can often be over lunch, so don't feel bad if I choose to sit at my desk and eat rather than in the cantine!

## Things I love

Using analogies to explain complexity! If you'd like to explain something to me in conversation, I respond _very_ well to analogies. Make it as real-world as possible, my imagination can take care of the rest.


GM I love collaborating on things, be it brain storming sessions, pair programming or random conversations about things.

GM I like hearing about other people's challenges, it helps me get comfortable with my own, and gives me opportunities to share my own experience and ideas.

GM I love teaching, mentor individuals outside of the workplace, and am always open to taking on new mentees (time permitted).

## Other things to know about me

I'm from Montreal, Canada, and have lived in the UK since the age of 11! Locations include Surrey, Bristol, Sheffield (for university) and now London. I'm still a very passionate Canuck.

I'll talk your ear off about video games, music technology and _some_ sports. 
I've recently become hooked on bouldering, and am always looking for people to join in! I try and go at least twice a week.
